      <p class="pfirst"><span>The purpose of this book is to aid the young experimenter in building and operating his own electrical apparatus and instruments. Every boy of now-a-days experiments with electricity and the right sort of book which furnishes him with ideas gets close to his heart. Of books upon electricity there is no end. That is granted. But there are very few</span> <em class="italics">practical</em> <span>books for the young experimenter who wishes to construct miscellaneous electrical apparatus for his own amusement and instruction which really amounts to something and which is worth his pains when the labor has been finished.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>This book is therefore offered as a volume of instruction for making all sorts of batteries, rectifiers, motors, etc., which are entirely out of the toy class and yet are not so elaborate that they cannot be easily constructed</span> <em class="italics">at home</em> <span>by the average boy who is willing to put a little care into his work. The materials required are such that they can he procured without any great expense.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>It has been planned to present the material in such a manner that it will aid the judgment of the young experimenter and assist him in developing his own ideas. Without exception, all of the apparatus described in the following pages has been actually constructed by the author, not only once but many times and put to a practical test before being embodied into the book. You may therefore be sure that if you follow the instructions carefully, that the result will in each case be a substantial piece of apparatus which is capable of fulfilling all of your expectations.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The drawings have all been reproduced on a large scale and in almost every case the dimensions of even the smallest details have been given. Some of the apparatus has been described in the pages of the "Boys' Magazine" and since its publication the readers of that magazine have written to the author asking questions about the apparatus which have enabled him when rewriting the material for publication in book form to clear up many questions and further explain in a little more detail many of the problems which naturally occur to the boy who likes to build his own electrical devices.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">Static Electricity</strong> <span>is an extremely interesting subject for the amateur experimenter, in view of the many spectacular experiments which may be performed with it. The number of such experiments is almost unlimited.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>Static electricity was the first evidence of the wonderful force which in the present day moves trains, lights our homes, etc., to come to the notice of man. Long before the days of batteries, dynamos, telegraphs, electric lights and before, perhaps, such things were even dreamed of, static electricity absorbed the attention of scientists, and the names of some of the world's greatest men such as for instance, Aristotle, Roger Bacon, Gilbert, Boyle, Newton, Franklin, etc., are closely linked with its history. It is probably safe to say that experiments with static electricity led the famous Italian, Galvani, to the discovery of the sort of electricity called</span> <strong class="bold">galvanic</strong> <span>currents, and to the battery. Galvanic current is the sort of electricity produced by batteries and has the same properties in many ways as that generated by huge dynamos in the power houses of to-day.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The modern boy can duplicate these old experiments far more easily and on a larger scale than any of the old scientists could, owing to the fact that he is supplied with explicit directions and can easily obtain the necessary materials at a neighboring hardware or electrical store, whereas men like Newton and Franklin not only had to</span> <strong class="bold">devise</strong> <span>or</span> <strong class="bold">invent</strong> <span>their own apparatus but make their materials as well.</span></p>

        <p class="pnext"><span>Rub the rod briskly and then hold it over some tiny bits of paper or specks of dust and watch them jump up to meet the rod, just as if the latter were a magnet attracting small tacks or nails. It is static electricity which gives the rod this wonderful power. If you rub the rod briskly and then hold it close to your cheek, you will feel a slight tickling and hear a faint crackling sound. If this is done in the dark you may be able to see a very faint phosphorescent light or even small sparks.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The quantity of electricity produced in this manner by rubbing a glass rod is extremely limited and while a number of very interesting and instructive experiments may be performed in this manner, the most spectacular ones are only possible with the aid of a "static-machine".</span></p>

        </div>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The most practical form of static machine is that known as the "Wimshurst". It consists of two circular plates made of glass or hard rubber arranged so that by turning a crank, they may be revolved in opposite directions. On these plates are a number of small strips of tinfoil. The static electricity is generated on these tinfoil strips and collected by two metal rods having small pins arranged along them in a row.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>A simple form of Wimshurst machine which any boy can easily make is illustrated in Figure 1. It will generate considerable static electricity and will make sparks two inches long.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">The Plates</strong> <span>on these machines are hard rubber. They are illustrated in Figure 2. Glass is usually used for static machine plates, but has the disadvantage of breaking easily. It is also hard for the young experimenter to cut out circular glass plates and drill them. The author has had very good success with hard rubber.</span></p>

It consists simply of a wide mouthed jar or bottle coated with tinfoil part way up on both the outside and the inside in exactly the same manner as the small test tubes used on the static machine.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>Not all glass jars are suitable for making Leyden Jars. The quality of the glass varies considerably and some will be found far superior to the rest.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The glass vessels used by chemists and called "beaker glasses" usually make excellent Leyden Jars.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>It is not very difficult to make a good Leyden Jar. After you have selected the jar or bottle you wish to use, clean and dry it very thoroughly. Then give the inside a thorough brushing over with shellac. Cut a strip of tinfoil which is long enough to go all the way around the inside of the jar and about two-thirds its height. Before the shellac is thoroughly dry but is still sticky, insert the tinfoil strip carefully into the jar and press it smoothly against the glass.</span></p>

A "lightning board" consists of a pane of glass having a number of small squares of tinfoil stuck on it so that when the electrical discharge is passed over it, sparks take place between the little tinfoil squares and produce an effect something like miniature lightning.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>A lightning board suitable for the static machine just described may be made from a strip of ordinary window glass about nine inches long and two inches wide.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>Clean the glass thoroughly and then give it a coat of shellac on one side. As soon as the shellac becomes sticky, lay on a strip of tinfoil the same size as the glass and rub it down smoothly. When the shellac has thoroughly dried so that the tinfoil is stuck tightly to the glass, the board is ready to be cut up into squares. This can be best accomplished by means of a sharp knife and a ruler. Use care in doing the work so as not to tear the tinfoil and be sure that the knife cuts all the way through to the glass. Leave two solid strips of tinfoil at each end to which to make connections.</span></p>

        <p class="pnext"><span>If one of the tinfoil strips left solid at the end of the board is connected to one of the discharge rods on the static machine and the other end is connected likewise to the other discharge rod innumerable little sparks will zig-zag between the tinfoil squares when the machine is set in operation. The effect is quite pretty if the experiment is performed in a dark room.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The Leyden jar can be charged by the static machine and discharged through the lightning board. The sparks produced by the Leyden jar will be much more brilliant than those of the static machine above.</span></p>

      <p class="pfirst"><span>Only those who are so fortunate as to live in a house wired for light and power service and supplied from the street mains, are likely to be able to utilize the first named. Those experimenters who live in towns where there are no commercial power wires or whose homes are not wired for such service will have to therefore depend upon a dynamo or a battery.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>A dynamo is a very satisfactory source of current, provided some sort of power, such as a windmill, water motor or small engine is available for driving it. A hand dynamo is unsatisfactory for some purposes because the experimenter is usually unable to drive the dynamo and attend to other work at the same time.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>Batteries are the most expensive source of current but for many reasons, as explained above, are all that is available to the average experimenter.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>There are two classes of batteries, known as</span></p>
      <ol class="arabic simple">
        <li>
          <p class="first pfirst"><span>Primary batteries;</span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="first pfirst"><span>Secondary or storage batteries.</span></p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="pfirst"><strong class="bold">Primary Batteries</strong> <span>are those which generate their own current by the action of some chemical such as, for example, an acid upon a metal.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">Secondary Batteries</strong> <span>derive their current from a dynamo or other source of electricity and store it away in the form of</span> <strong class="bold">Chemical energy</strong> <span>until it is used up. A storage battery might be likened to a pail, which can be carried to a dynamo and filled full of electricity. Those who possess a storage battery can recharge it themselves from the 110-volt lighting or power circuit, from a dynamo or by taking it to an automobile garage where recharging is done.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>Homemade batteries are not as practical as those which can be purchased ready made, but the knowledge and experience gained in making your own are so valuable that every experimenter is urged to start in this way.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>Various materials such as zinc, copper, carbon, etc., can be used to make some very interesting and valuable batteries.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>One of the most common mistakes made in reference to cells and batters is in calling a single cell a</span> <strong class="bold">battery</strong><span>. One cell is a cell. More than one cell connected together is a</span> <strong class="bold">battery of cells</strong> <span>or simply a</span> <strong class="bold">battery</strong><span>.</span></p>
      <div class="level-3 section" id="the-voltaic-cell">
        <h3 class="level-3 pfirst section-title title"><span>The Voltaic Cell.</span></h3>
        <p class="pfirst"><span>The first practical cell was invented in 1786 by an Italian professor named Volta and it is, therefore usually called the Voltaic cell.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>A Voltaic cell may be easily made by the experimenter, by placing some water, mixed with sulphuric acid, in a glass tumbler or a jelly jar and then immersing therein a strip of zinc and a strip of copper, each about four inches long and one inch wide. The strips must be kept separate from one another and should be scraped clean and bright before they are placed in the solution. A copper wire is fastened to the top of each one of the strips. The acid solution should be composed of one part of acid, mixed with ten parts of water.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>When mixing acid and water, always remember to pour the acid into the water and never pour water into acid. Otherwise the solution will suddenly become very hot and is liable to crack the jar. Acid should always be mixed in a glass or earthenware vessel and never in any sort of a wooden or metal receptacle, because it will attack and dissolve metals and wood.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>As soon as the acid has been prepared for the Voltaic cell fill a tumbler about three quarters full and then immerse the zinc and copper strips therein. As soon as the strips are in the acid, bubbles will commence to rise from the zinc. These bubbles are a gas called hydrogen and are evidence of a chemical action which takes place in a battery. The zinc is being dissolved by the acid and during the process, sets free hydrogen gas.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>It will probably be noticed that very few bubbles arise from the copper plate and that there seems to be little chemical action there.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>It will also be noticed that if the two wires connected to the strips are brought together the bubbles will arise from the zinc much faster than before. That is because, when the wires are connected together, a complete electrical circuit is formed: The zinc is really being oxidized or slowly burned. If zinc is burned in the open air or in a fire it will give out its energy in the form of heat but when it is burned in an acid solution in the presence of another metal it gives out its energy in the form of electricity.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The zinc strip in a Voltaic battery is known as the</span> <strong class="bold">negative</strong> <span>pole or cathode, and the copper strip, as the positive pole or anode. When the electrical circuit is completed by touching the two wires connected to the poles together, the current is supposed to flow from the positive pole through the wires and back into the solution through the negative pole.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>If the two wires, instead of being connected together, are connected to an electrical instrument called a voltmeter the needle or pointer on the meter will swing over and point to about one volt.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">A Voltmeter</strong> <span>is an instrument for measuring electrical pressure or</span> <strong class="bold">potential</strong><span>. The pressure of an electric current is measured in</span> <strong class="bold">volts</strong> <span>just as the pressure of water may be measured in</span> <strong class="bold">pounds</strong><span>.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>If the copper strip is lifted out of the solution and a carbon plate or rod also having a wire attached is substituted in its place it will be found that the voltage or potential has increased to one and one-half volts. Zinc and carbon are said to have a greater potential difference than zinc and copper and inasmuch as it is usually desirable for a battery to have the greatest potential difference possible, zinc and carbon are employed in the batteries of to-day instead of zinc and copper.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>If the wires are then disconnected from the voltmeter and connected to an electrical instrument called an</span> <strong class="bold">ammeter</strong><span>, the needle or pointer will probably swing over until it indicates a current of perhaps ten amperes. An</span> <strong class="bold">ammeter</strong> <span>is an instrument for measuring the volume of an electric current. An</span> <strong class="bold">ampere</strong> <span>is a unit of current and is used to designate the rate of flow just as feet per second are used to denote rate of flow in the case of water in a pipe.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>If the meter is allowed to remain connected to the cell for a short time it will be noticed that the pointer will commence to slowly drop back towards zero.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The cell is then becoming</span> <strong class="bold">polarized</strong><span>, which is to say that small bubbles of hydrogen which are liberated by the chemical action, collect on the carbon and cause the strength of the battery to fall off. If the battery is agitated or the carbon is lifted out and scraped it will be found that the current will immediately rise again to its first strength.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>It would be a nuisance if it were continually necessary to scrape the carbon or shake the battery so as to avoid</span> <strong class="bold">polarization</strong> <span>and so another means is employed to secure the desired result.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>This is accomplished by introducing certain chemicals into the solution which will give forth</span> <strong class="bold">oxygen</strong><span>. When oxygen and hydrogen meet under proper conditions they combine and form ordinary</span> <strong class="bold">water</strong><span>.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">Bichromate of potash</strong> <span>or as it is also often called</span> <strong class="bold">potassium bichromate</strong> <span>is the chemical most commonly employed for this purpose.</span></p>

        <p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">Carbon rods</strong> <span>and</span> <strong class="bold">plates</strong> <span>may be purchased from an electrical supply house but they can also be easily and cheaply obtained from old dry cells. Dry cells may be split open with a cold chisel and a hammer. Care should be exercised not to break the carbon in removing it.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The round carbon rods used in arc lamps may be used for making batteries provided that if they are copper plated, the copper is first removed by immersing the rod in a bath of nitric acid. If this precaution is not taken there will be a "local action" set up between the copper and the carbon and the battery will not be as efficient as it will be if the copper is removed.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>Carbon rods and plates are easily drilled with an ordinary hand drill. Carbon is quite brittle and breaks easily, therefore only very light pressure should be used.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>While zinc rods and plates may also be purchased they are easily made by the experimenter who possesses a little ingenuity. The melting point of zinc is quite low. It can be melted in a small iron pot and cast into the form of rods or plates in plaster-of-Paris moulds. Plates may also be cut out of heavy sheet zinc.</span></p>

The strip is used to support the plates and rests across the top of the jar so that the plates hang below in the solution. Most chemicals attack wood and for that reason it is well to dip the strip in some hot paraffin. The carbon and zinc plates are fastened on opposite sides of the wooden strip by means of a round headed screw and a washer. A wire lead should be placed under the washer on each plate. If the screw and washer are then smeared with some hot paraffin or vaseline they will be protected from corrosion.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>Care should be used so that the two screws employed to fasten the plates to the strip do not touch each other in the wood. If they should, the battery will be "short circuited" and the current will flow through the screws instead of the wires.</span></p>

        <p class="pfirst"><span>It has already been shown how cells become "polarized" when the solution consists simply of sulphuric acid and water. An ordinary acid solution also has the further disadvantage that the zinc element is continually consumed by the acid when it is in the solution, regardless of whether current is being drawn from the cell or not. It is of course consumed more rapidly when the circuit is complete and current is flowing than when it is not, but the action is still nevertheless sufficiently rapid to entirely consume the zinc even in the latter case in a very short time. If an ordinary acid solution is used therefore as the liquid or</span> <strong class="bold">electrolyte</strong><span>, as it is technically termed, it is always necessary to lift the elements out of their solutions whenever the cells are not in use. They should be lifted out and carefully washed so as to remove all traces of acid.</span></p>

        <p class="pnext"><span>A milder chemical which does not attack the zinc so rapidly as an acid is often used wherever a battery is to be employed for ringing bells, operating sounders, telephoning, etc., and only a small amount is required.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>Sal-ammoniac or chloride of ammonium, as it is also called, is a good chemical for this purpose. It is very cheap and only requires to be dissolved in water. A good strong solution should be made and an element consisting of several carbons and one zinc such as those shown in Figures 29, 30 and 31 used.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>Such a cell will give about 1.5 volts and 3 or 4 amperes. If the current is drawn from the battery continuously or too rapidly, it will also</span> <strong class="bold">polarize</strong> <span>and the current will begin to fall off. The advantage of a sal-ammoniac cell is that the elements may be left in the solution when the cell is not in use, without appreciable waste of the zinc.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>A very powerful cell of the non-polarizing type capable of delivering a heavy current and having an E. M. F. of two volts can be made by adding some potassium bichromate to a sulphuric acid solution.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>An electrolyte of this sort may be prepared by dissolving four ounces of bichromate of potash in sixteen ounces of water. Add to this, four ounces of sulphuric acid. The acid should be added slowly and the solution stirred at the same time.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>This solution will be found an excellent one to use with cells having carbon and zinc elements. The current and voltage are much higher than those of an ordinary acid solution.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>This type of cell also has the disadvantage that the zincs waste away rapidly when in the solution, regardless of whether current is being drawn or not. This can be partly overcome by</span> <strong class="bold">amalgamating</strong> <span>the zincs with mercury. In order to amalgamate your battery zincs, procure a little</span> <strong class="bold">mercuric nitrate</strong> <span>from a druggist or chemical house. Dissolve the mercuric nitrate in a small amount of water and then rub the zincs with a wad of cotton or cloth which has been dipped in the mercuric nitrate solution.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The arrangement shown in Figure 32 is a very convenient one to follow in arranging a battery of three or more cells. The elements of three cells are all mounted upon a strip of paraffined wood and connected in series. The three battery jars are placed in a row so that each pair of elements will dip into their proper jar when the strip is laid across the tops.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>Such an arrangement is not only more compact than one having the elements composing each cell mounted upon separate strips, but will be found very convenient when an electrolyte composed of bichromate of potash and acid is used, because all the elements may then be raised out of the solutions at the same time.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>It is possible to place the jars in a frame and arrange a windlass fitted with a crank so that the elements may be easily raised or lowered from and to the solution. Such an arrangement is called a "plunge battery."</span></p>

        <p class="pnext"><span>Cells are in series when they are connected with a wire leading from the negative pole of one of the positive pole of another, so that the current flows through each one in turn. Figure 33 shows six cells connected in series. Cells are placed in series when voltage is the most important factor. The total voltage of the battery is then equal to the sum of the voltages of the cells. For example, the voltage of the ordinary dry cell is about 1.5 and therefore if four dry cells are connected in series the total voltage of the battery will be six. If six dry cells are connected in series the voltage at the terminals will be about nine.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>When a heavy amperage is desired, cells are connected in multiple. Figure 34 shows six cells connected in multiple. It will be noticed that all the negative poles are connected together to form one terminal, while all the positive poles form another. The amperage of the average dry cell is about 20. The amperage of a battery of cells connected in multiple is equal to the sum of the amperages of the separate cells. The amperage of four cells connected in multiple will be about 80 and about 120 in the case of six cells.</span></p>

        <p class="pnext"><span>The life of the average dry cell is about twenty ampere hours under normal conditions. If however the cell is discharged at a high rate, say for instance, five amperes, it will be found that the life is less than twenty ampere hours. On the other hand, if the discharge rate is very low, as for example, one-quarter of an ampere, the capacity of the cell will be greater. In order to get the most economical service from a battery it is therefore advisable to lighten the load as far as possible, and cells are consequently often connected in</span> <strong class="bold">series-multiple</strong> <span>with that result in view. In a case, for illustration, where it might be desirable to secure a current 4 1/2 volts and five amperes from dry cells, the series-multiple arrangement could be recommended. Three dry cells connected in series will furnish 4 1/2 volts and five amperes, but by using two sets as in Figure 35, the load is divided between them and each set will only have to furnish amperes to the circuit.</span> <strong class="bold">Two sets of cells used in series-multiple will therefore last more than twice as long as either set would alone.</strong></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The series-multiple arrangement is recommended where cells are to be used for operating toy trains, induction coils, motors, etc., as being the most economical.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>Always be sure to use large wire in connecting cells. Fine wire offers considerable resistance to the electrical current and the full benefit of the batteries cannot be secured when it is used.</span></p>

        <p class="pfirst"><span>Storage cells are especially affected by the usage given them. If they are mistreated they will quickly go to pieces, whereas, on the other hand if well treated they will last indefinitely.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>It is important that the electrolyte used in the cells should always be of the proper strength. The only accurate method of preparing the electrolyte is with the aid of a</span> <strong class="bold">hydrometer</strong><span>. A hydrometer is an instrument for determining the specific gravity of solutions.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>It is a little device which looks somewhat like a thermometer. It is placed in the solution and allowed to float. There is a numbered scale along the upper part of the hydrometer and the</span> <strong class="bold">specific gravity</strong> <span>or strength of the solution is indicated on the scale by the point which is level with the surface of the solution.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The normal specific gravity for a storage battery solution should be about 1.250. The strength can be increased by adding more acid and decreased by adding water.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>Ordinary commercial or technical grades of sulphuric acid and ordinary water are satisfactory for primary batteries, but the acid and water used in making the electrolyte for storage cells must be</span> <strong class="bold">chemically pure</strong> <span>if you wish to obtain good results and desire your batteries to hold their charge while standing.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>Storage cells can be recharged with DIRECT current only. A dynamo for recharging storage cells must be SHUNT wound. The voltage of the charging current must be greater than that of the storage cells. About three volts of charging current will be required for each cell of the storage battery. Cells may be connected in multiple when recharging so as to bring the voltage of the cells below that of the charging current. It will of course, however, take much longer to recharge cells connected in multiple than the same cells connected in series, provided that the amperage of the current is the same.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>Storage cells must not be recharged too rapidly. It is better to recharge them slowly rather than too rapidly. Two amperes is plenty for small cells of 10-15 ampere hours capacity. Three amperes is sufficient for cells of 15-25 ampere hours capacity. Five to six amperes is the right charging rate for a 40 ampere hour battery and 8 amperes in the case of a 60 ampere hour battery.</span></p>

      <p class="pfirst"><span>It is often desirable to operate experimental apparatus and other electrical devices from the 110 volt lighting circuit. Such a circuit may be either direct or alternating, commonly spoken of as D.C. and A.C. The easiest method of reducing the voltage of the 110 volt circuit to a value where it can be used in place of an ordinary battery is to use a step-down transformer. A transformer will, however, operate only on alternating current and it is impossible to use it on a direct current circuit.</span></p>

      </div>
      <p class="pnext"><span>It is therefore necessary to secure the desired result by placing an adjustable resistance in the circuit and the most practical method of accomplishing this is to use a "lamp bank."</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">A Lamp Bank</strong> <span>consists of a number of incandescent lamps arranged on a board so that any desired number may be quickly included in or withdrawn from the circuit.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>Figure 48 illustrates such an arrangement. It consists of a number of Edison sockets of the type known as "flat-base porcelain receptacles", mounted in two rows upon a suitable baseboard. Six or ten receptacles will usually prove sufficient for the ordinary lamp bank.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The lamps are connected in "series-multiple." The diagram in the upper left hand corner of Figure 48 shows just how this is done. Four binding posts should be mounted upon one end of the board and marked A, B, B and C as shown. B and B are connected together, or to use an electrical term, are "in common."</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The 110 volt supply is connected to the posts B and C. If any electrical device is then connected to A and B and a lamp placed in each one of the receptacles, the lamps will be in series with the apparatus and lower the voltage of the 110 volt circuit to a value where it may be used for recharging storage cells, operating toy motors, electroplating, lighting miniature lamps, running toy railways, etc.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>110 volt carbon lamps should be used on a lamp bank operated on a 110 volt circuit. Carbon lamps consume more current than tungsten lamps and it will therefore not be necessary to use as many. Each 16 c.p. 110 volt lamp used will allow about one-half of an ampere to pass through the circuit. Thirty-two candle power bulbs of the same voltage will pass about one ampere, while an 8 c.p. bulb will only permit one-quarter of an ampere to flow.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>It is therefore very easy to regulate the amount of current flowing by using lamps of different sizes and screwing them in or out of the receptacles.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>A lamp bank such as this may of course be used on either the 110 volt A. C. or D. C. circuit.</span></p>

      <p class="pfirst"><span>Oftentimes the only source of electrical energy for experimental work is the 110 volt alternating current supply. This may be reduced to a voltage suitable for operating small battery motors, trains, lamps, etc., by means of a "lamp bank" resistance or a step-down transformer.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>Direct current is</span> <strong class="bold">necessary</strong> <span>however in order to recharge storage batteries and to operate many other devices. The electrolytic rectifier is a device for changing alternating current into direct current and will be found satisfactory for this purpose, provided too much is not demanded of it. It is fairly efficient if used only to rectify small amounts of current. It is not efficient when large amounts of currents are passed through it and quickly becomes very hot in such a case.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>An electrolytic rectifier consists of an electrode of iron or lead and one of aluminum immersed in a solution of sodium phosphate.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><span>It is a wise precaution to thoroughly saturate the cover with paraffin by immersing it in a molten bath of that material. If the cover is allowed to remain in the molten paraffin until all bubbles have ceased to rise, the paraffin will thoroughly permeate the wood and protect it from the action of the Chemical solution used in the rectifier.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><span>As stated above, one electrode may be made of iron or lead. The other should be aluminum. The electrode may be cut out of sheet metal and made in the form of a strip about one and one-half inches wide and six inches long. The top of each electrode is bent over at right angles and bored with a small drill and an 8-32 brass machine screw is passed through the hole and through the cover into the bottom of the binding post mounted on the top of the cover, thereby serving not only to fasten the electrode securely in place to the underside of the cover, but also to establish connection between the electrode and the binding post itself.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>Electrodes which are cut out of sheet metal possess the disadvantage that they are not quite as efficient and will not last as long as electrodes which are cast.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>Cast electrodes are much heavier and far more efficient in many other ways. They cannot be easily made by the young experimenter, but may be procured from any one of several firms dealing in supplies for experimenters.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><span>The action of the electrolytic rectifier, in changing alternating current into direct current, is interesting and peculiar. The rectifier acts much like a valve which opens one way and closes the other.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>If a battery is connected to the electrodes of a rectifier, the positive pole of the battery being connected to the lead or iron electrode and the negative of the battery to the aluminum electrode of the rectifier, the current from the battery will flow through the rectifier and nothing unusual will happen. If, however, the poles are reversed so that the positive pole is connected to the aluminum electrode, oxygen gas will form on the aluminum. The action of the oxygen gas is to combine with the aluminum and form a coating of</span> <strong class="bold">aluminum oxide</strong> <span>all over the electrode. Aluminum oxide is an insulator and it therefore quickly forms an insulating coating which shields the electrode from the solution and stops the passage of the current. This action is almost instantaneous.</span></p>

      </div>
      <p class="pnext"><span>A step-down transformer cannot be used to recharge storage cells or for electro-plating unless the current is first passed through a rectifier.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>A transformer is both in principle and construction really very simple.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>It consists simply of two coils of wire wound around an iron core. One coil consists of many turns of fine wire and is connected to the 110 volt alternating current. This coil is called the</span> <strong class="bold">primary</strong><span>. The other coil consists of a smaller number of turns of larger wire and is called the</span> <strong class="bold">secondary</strong><span>. The lower voltage currents are obtained from the secondary.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The first step to take in making a transformer is to procure some sheet iron of the sort used for making stove pipes. It is called stove pipe iron.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>This iron will have to be cut into a number of pieces like A and B in Figure 58.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The exact shape and dimensions are most easily understood from the illustration. A somewhat resembles a three-pronged fork, while B is simply a strip 2 5/8 inches long and 1/2 inch wide.</span></p>

          <span class="italics">FIG. 59.—The Method used in piling up the Strips to Assemble the Core.</span>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="pnext"><span>A sufficient quantity of each piece will be required to make a pile three-quarters of an inch thick when tightly compressed.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The best method of procedure is to lay out one piece like "A" very accurately and then cut it out. Hammer it out perfectly flat and use it as a pattern to lay out the other pieces with. The cutting can be done with a pair of ordinary tin snips. The pieces should all be cut very accurately and truly so that they will match when piled up. The rough edges of the iron can be smoothed up with a file.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>Figure 60 shows how the core should look when it is assembled. It should form a rectangle three and three-quarters inches long and two and five-eighths inches wide.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The method of piling up the</span> <strong class="bold">laminations</strong><span>, as the pieces forming the core are called, is illustrated in Figure 59. One of the strips B is placed against the open end of A. The next set of strips is arranged in the same manner except that the position is reversed so that the strip B is at the opposite end of the pile. This method is continued, reversing each alternate set of strips until the pile is complete as shown in Figure 60. After the core has been assembled, examine it carefully and make certain that none of the strips are of the wrong size so that some protrude farther than others.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The next step in the work is to make the windings, The windings are each made on a cardboard tube having an inside diameter of about 1 1/16 inches. The tubes may be made by rolling a strip of wrapping paper around a piece of broom handle or some other round object of the proper size. The edges of the tube should be glued so that it cannot unroll.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><span>The windings must be carefully made and every care taken to see that they are properly insulated. It is a very good plan to insert a layer of paper between each two layers of wire.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>After the windings are finished they are ready to assemble on the core. In order to put them in place, the core must be taken apart first. The primary and secondary go along side of each other on the centre tongue of the A strips.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The core is put together again with the windings in position by slipping each alternate "A" strip through from the opposite direction so that when it is all assembled the result is like that shown in Figure 62.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The transformer is now ready for mounting. The usual method of mounting a step-down transformer is to place it in an iron box or case. This is of course the best way because the windings and core are then protected. The experimenter who wishes to go to the trouble of building an iron box for his transformer will find it worth the time.</span></p>

        <p class="pnext"><span>The wooden bobbin which holds the wire is shown in Figure 68. The exact dimensions are best understood from the illustration. The wood can be easily secured from an old cigar box. In laying out the work, scratch the lines on the wood with the point of a darning needle. Pencil lines are too thick to permit of accuracy in small work. The bobbin should be perfectly square and true when finished. Finish by rubbing with fine sandpaper and then give it a coat of shellac. Two bobbins will be required, one for the voltmeter and one for the ammeter. Do not use any nails in putting the bobbins together. Use strong glue only.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The bobbin for the ammeter should be wound full of No. 14 B. &amp; S. Gauge double cotton covered magnet wire. The voltmeter requires much smaller wire. No. 37 B. &amp; S. Gauge single silk covered wire will serve the purpose satisfactorily, but a finer size such as No. 38 or 40, is better. Such fine sizes will probably, however, prove more difficult for the experimenter to obtain. Sufficient wire should be used to fill the bobbin up. The wire should be wound on carefully in smooth even layers.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>A small hole should be bored in one of the flanges, through which to pass the end of the wire when starting the first layer. About six inches of wire should be left at both ends of the coils to make connection to the terminals with. The whole winding should be given a coat of shellac when finished.</span></p>

        <p class="pnext"><span>The armature is a piece of soft steel, one and one-eighth inches long, and one-quarter of an inch thick. A one-sixteenth inch hole is bored, slightly above the centre of the armature, to receive the shaft. The centre of gravity is thus thrown below the centre of mass and the pointer attached to the armature will always return to zero if the instrument is level. The shaft is a piece of one-sixteenth inch bessemer steel rod, three-eighths of an inch long. The ends are filed to a sharp point as shown in the upper pert of Fig. 69. A small hole is bored in the top of the armature almost directly over the shaft as shown in Fig, 69 to receive the lower end of the pointer, which is a piece of No. 16 aluminum wire, three and one-quarter inches long. The other end of the pointer should be flattened slightly by tapping with a hammer and then filed into a shape resembling a spear head.</span></p>

        <p class="pnext"><span>After all the holes have been bored and before the shaft and the pointer are in place, the armature must be tempered so that it will retain its magnetism. In order to temper the armature, heat it to a bright red and drop it immediately into a basin of strong salt water. It may then be magnetized by rubbing one end against the pole of a strong magnet.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The bearings are formed by two 6-32 brass screws, one-half an inch long and having a small hole in the end to accommodate the end of the shaft. These screws pass through the upper flange of the bobbin from the opposite sides. The holes in the flanges should be slightly smaller than the outside of the screw so that the latter will fit snugly and "take hold" as if the wood were threaded.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>Figures 70 and 71 show two different methods of assembling and completing the instruments. In one, the bobbin is mounted on the base and the scale is at the top. In the other, this relation is just turned abound and the bobbin is at the top and the scale at the bottom. In the latter case the pointer must be attached to the bottom of the armature instead of the top.</span></p>

A small, round-headed brass screw, long enough to pass all the way through the base will serve to level the instrument and bring the pointer exactly at zero. If a little brass strip is placed in the slot in the screw head and soldered there so as to form what is known as a "winged screw", the adjustment may be made with the fingers and without the aid of a screw driver.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The scale is formed on a piece of stiff white cardboard directly under the pointer. The scale is supported by gluing it to two small wooden blocks. The various values are marked on the scale with a pen and ink. The glass front should therefore not be put in place until the instrument has been calibrated.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>To properly calibrate the meters, they must be compared with a suitable standard.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The zero value on the meters is normally in the centre of the scale. When a current is passed through the bobbins, the armature tends to swing around at right angles. But since the armature is pivoted above its centre of mass, the centre of gravity is displaced when it swings and exerts a pull in opposition to that of the bobbin. The amount of swing will be greater as the current is correspondingly stronger. The pointer will swing either to the right or to the left, depending upon the direction in which the current passes through the coil of wire on the bobbin.</span></p>

The lower 7 part of Figure 78 shows a cross section of the base. The groove is three and one-eighth inches in diameter inside, five-sixteenths of an inch thick and five thirty-seconds of an inch wide. The hole in the centre of the base is to accommodate the shaft of the switch lever, Two holes, seven-eighths of an inch apart are drilled at the back of the base to accommodate the binding posts. The binding posts' holes and also the hole in the centre of the base for the shaft are countersunk at the bottom as shown in Figure 79.</span></p>

        <p class="pnext"><span>If the experimenter has access to a lathe it is possible to wind the wire on the fibre strip under tension with the aid of the screw feed so that the wire will go on very tightly and with a small air space between the turns. When a lathe is not available it will be necessary to groove the top and bottom of the fibre strip with the aid of a three-cornered file. The grooves should be evenly spaced and as close together as possible. They serve to prevent the wire from slipping and the adjacent turns becoming short circuited.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The wire used to wind the strip should be No. 24 B. &amp; S. Gauge German Silver wire and should be bare.

        <p class="pnext"><span>The fibre strip can be bent so that it will fill in the groove in the wooden base by heating it in the flame of a bunsen burner. It should not, of course, be heated too hot or the fibre will burn. Warm it thoroughly and bend into a circle of the same diameter as the groove in the base. Then force the strip into the groove with the two ends opposite the two binding post holes. The strip should fit into the groove tightly so that there is no danger of it shifting or slipping out.</span></p>

        <p class="pnext"><span>The rheostat may be connected in a circuit by attaching two wires to the binding posts. It should be placed in series with any device which it is desired to regulate. The carrying capacity is limited to two amperes owing to the fact that a heavier current than this will cause the wire to overheat. Turning the knob so that the lever moves towards the upholsterer's nail, which raises it up off the wire, increases the amount of resistance in the circuit and cuts down the current, until the lever slides up on the nail when the circuit is broken entirely. Moving the knob in the other direction decreases the resistance and increases the current until the lever has moved as far as it may, when the current will be at a maximum.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><span>The key is really a form of switch and is simply a contrivance for controlling the electric current. It consists of a steel lever, pivoted in the centre, and provided with a rubber knob, which the operator grasps lightly with the thumb and forefinger. When the lever is pressed downwards, a platinum point on the under side is brought into contact with another similar point set into a rubber bushing in the base of the key, so that there is no electrical connection between the two points unless the key is pressed down or "closed" as it is usually termed.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The receiving device, or "sounder," consists of two electro-magnets mounted on a base under a flat strip or iron, called the armature, which is attracted by the magnetism of the electro-magnets when a current flows through them, and is withdrawn by a spring when no magnetism is produced by the windings.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><span>The armature is usually mounted on a strip of brass or aluminum called the "lever". The lever strikes against an anvil and produces the clicks which form the dots and dashes of the telegraph alphabet.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>Every time the key is pressed, an electric current goes through the line, causing the magnets to draw the armature downward and produce a click. When the key lever is released, the current is shut off and the lever flies up and clicks against the top of the anvil.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The time between the first and second clicks may be easily varied at will, by changing the length of time that the key lever is held down. Two clicks very close together, made by pressing the key and immediately releasing it, are called a "dot". A "dash" is made by pressing the key down and holding it down for a fraction of a second so that the interval between the first and second clicks is about three times as long as that between the clicks of a dot.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><span>Any boy can make a simple telegraph set quite easily. The only drawback of such an apparatus, however, is that it is usually not practical for long lines but may only be used for ticking messages from one room to another.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>It is equally possible for the young experimenter to make a perfectly practical telegraph outfit which will operate over a line a mile long, if he is willing to give the time and labor necessary to the work.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The telegraph set-described below is one which, because of its simplicity, particularly lends itself to construction by the young experimenter whose tools are rather limited.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>In order to make a really practical telegraph outfit, it is almost essential that the key and sounder frame be made out of cast iron so as to give the instruments the requisite stiffness. It is easier to use castings than to attempt to bend the parts out of metal.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>In order to secure the proper castings it will be necessary to first make a set of "patterns". This is not very difficult.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The key frame is shown in Figure 83 and the Sounder frame in Figure 84. The patterns should be cut out of wood according to the exact shape and dimensions shown in the illustrations. Omit all the holes, however, because no holes should appear in the patterns but only in the finished castings.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><span>The patterns should be made perfectly smooth and be a good, clean job throughout. After they are finished, give them each a coat of shellac and they are ready for the foundry. Almost any iron foundry will make up the castings if supplied with the patterns. If a number of experimenters "chip in" and make up a set of patterns from which several sets of castings are ordered at the same time, the cost will be very slight.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>After the castings are secured, they should be cleaned up with a file and drilled according to the illustration in Figures 83 and 84. Several of the holes should be tapped to receive an 8-30 machine screw. Such holes are marked in the illustrations.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The holes not marked "Tap" should be just large enough to allow an 8-32 screw to slip through.</span></p>

It serves both as the armature and the sounder lever. The exact location of the holes is shown in Figure 86. The holes "h" and "i" should be tapped to receive an 8-32 screw. The hole "j" should pass a screw of the same size. This screw serves as the pivot for the armature. Figure 87 shows how the sounder frame should appear when the lever is in position. The screw A controls the distance which the armature moves on its upward stroke. The screw B strikes the "anvil" on the downward stroke and controls the distance between the armature and the electro-magnets.</span></p>

Two long 8-32 machine screws pass upwards through the wooden base, through the holes "e" and "f" in the sounder frame and into the bottom of the magnets, thus serving not only to hold the magnets in position but also the sounder frame to the base.</span></p>

The circuit closing lever is pivoted to the back end so that it can swing. The key lever should be fitted with a regular key knob and the circuit closing lever with a small knob such as is generally used for the purpose. Both of these styles of knobs can be purchased from almost any electrical supply house.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The contact points are best made of silver. Silver makes a better contact metal than almost anything else, with the exception of platinum. If silver cannot be obtained a piece of large german-silver wire may be used.</span></p>

      <p class="pfirst"><span>Not many years ago, the telephone was the wonder of the times just as the aeroplane and the wireless are to-day. The original telephone apparatus was an exceedingly crude and simple arrangement which has gradually developed into a wonderful and complex system which makes it possible to carry on a conversation with almost any other point in the United States as easily as it is face to face.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><span>Many of my young readers have undoubtedly already constructed a set of telegraph instruments and rigged up a line with some nearby chum. Like the telegraph, the principle of the telephone is that of a current of electricity flowing over a line wire into a pair of electro-magnets, and it is not any more difficult to install a short telephone line than a telegraph. Of course there are many important differences between a telephone and a telegraph but they are not intricate or complex.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The telephone is exceedingly sensitive when compared to the telegraph. An ordinary telegraph relay requires about one hundredth of an ampere to operate it, whereas a telephone receiver will produce an audible sound on a current of less than one millionth of an ampere.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><span>The telephone may be defined as an apparatus for transmitting speech to a distance by means of electricity. The part of the apparatus which takes up the sounds and changes them into electric currents is the transmitter. Where words are spoken into the mouth-piece of the transmitter, they strike a thin metal diaphragm, to the back of which is fastened a small cup-shaped piece of carbon. A second cup is mounted in a rigid position directly back of the first and the space between is filled with small polished granules of carbon. When the granules are undisturbed and are lying loosely together their resistance to an electric current is so great that they allow almost none to flow.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>When the vibrations of the voice strike the diaphragm they move it back and forth and cause the carbon cup mounted on its back to move and exert a varying pressure on the granules. When the granules are compressed their resistance is greatly lowered and they permit current to pass.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>That part of the apparatus which transforms the pulsating current back into sound waves is called the receiver. It consists of a thin iron disk, placed very near but not quite touching the end of a small permanent magnet about which is wound a coil of fine insulated wire.</span></p>

      </div>
      <p class="pnext"><span>If the transmitter and receiver are connected together in series with a battery and words are spoken into the transmitter, the little carbon granules are immediately thrown into motion, and being alternately compressed and released cause corresponding changes in the current flowing through the receiver from the battery.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The strength of the magnetic pull exerted by the combined permanent magnet and coil of wire varies with each change in the electric current and thus by alternately attracting and repelling the diaphragm causes it to vibrate and emit sounds.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>This is the general principle of the telephone. The telephones in actual service to-day are complicated with bells, induction coils, condensers and relays, which render them more efficient, but the general principle of the transmission of the speech is the same.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>I would not advise the young experimenter to attempt to build his own transmitter and receiver except for the knowledge and experience gained thereby. Homemade instruments of this sort are not likely to prove sensitive enough for practical purposes over a long line.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>A first class telephone receiver can be purchased for 90 cents and an equally good transmitter for $2.25 These, together with an ordinary electric bell can be built into a first class telephone instrument which will give excellent service over a long line.</span></p>

These contacts are simply two small brass strips bent at right angles and fastened about an inch apart along the left hand edge of the wooden back by means of two small round headed brass wood screws. The position of the contacts should be such that the hook is in a horizontal position when it is half way between the two. A small spring is arranged so as to pull the hook up against the upper contact (No. 1) when the receiver is lifted off. When the receiver is hung on the hook, it should overcome the lift of the spring and pull the hook down against the lower contact (No. 2).</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">The Receiver</strong> <span>may be purchased at almost any reliable electrical supply house. It should be provided with a ring so that it can be hung onto the hook.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><span>Four binding posts should be arranged along the bottom of the wooden back and two more just to the left of the transmitter.</span></p>

The hook should be connected to binding post L. The upper contact 1 is connected to one terminal of the transmitter. The other terminal of the transmitter goes to binding post P2. The telephone receiver should be connected to the posts P1 and P2 by means, of flexible wire. The contact on the push button should be connected to the upper hook contact 1.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><span>The battery is connected to the binding posts marked B1 and B2. E and L are the line posts to which the wires connecting the two sets are led.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The wire connecting the two outfits should not be smaller than No. 18 B. &amp; S. gauge. No. 14 will prove better if the line is a long one.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The wire should be very carefully insulated. Ordinary porcelain knobs will serve as suitable insulators.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>If desirable, only one wire need be used, the circuit being completed by connecting the post E on each instrument to the ground or earth. The gas or water pipes will form the most suitable ground connection.</span></p>

It should be noticed that the battery connections at each station are reversed so that the batteries will be series.

The resistance of the receiver and transmitter, however, are so great that they will prevent enough current from flowing to ring the bell at the other station. Pressing the push button will short circuit the transmitter and receiver and allow enough current to flow to ring the bell at the other station.

      <p class="pnext"><span>A medical coil is nothing more or less than a small induction coil for raising the voltage of a battery high enough to produce a shock. The human body possesses so much resistance that the voltage of one or two cells of ordinary battery is not sufficient to pass enough current through to be felt except under exceptional conditions, as for instance when contact is made directly with a nerve through an open cut or a metal filling in a tooth.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>A small lathe will be of much assistance in making some of the parts and fittings for the medical coil, although it is not absolutely essential and the ingenious young experimenter can undoubtedly find some method of doing without it. It is not necessary to follow the dimensions given here exactly, and a very good coil can be built by adapting spools, binding posts, etc., which may already be on hand, although, of course, they should be used with some sense of proportion in mind so that nothing is carried to an extreme.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The first part which will be required is the bobbin. This is shown in Fig. 98 and consists of a wooden spool, two and seven-sixteenth inches long and one inch in diameter. It has a three-eighths inch hole running all the way through the center. The dimensions of the flanges, etc., can probably be best understood by referring directly to the illustration. The flanges are flattened slightly on one side so that when the bobbin is mounted the flat portion will rest on the base and give a better support.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">The Primary Winding</strong> <span>consists of two layers of No. 24 B. &amp; S. Gauge single cotton covered wire. The terminals of the winding should be led out through two small holes in the right hand head of the bobbin. Cover the winding with two or three layers of thin shellaced paper and then wind on the secondary. The secondary is composed of ten layers of No. 36 B. &amp; S. Gauge single cotton covered wire. The inside end of the secondary should be connected to the outside end of the primary. The outside terminal is led out through a small hole in the head at the opposite end from the primary leads.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The wire on both the primary and secondary should be wound on in smooth even layers. The illustration in Figure 99 shows the bobbin after the windings are finished.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">The Core</strong> <span>is made out of thin sheet iron rolled up into a cylinder two and three-sixteenths inches long and nine-thirty-seconds inches in diameter. The core should be rolled up just as tightly as possibly, because the more iron there is in the core, within of course reasonable limit, the better the coil will work. Thin tin plated iron cut from a cracker box may be used for the core. The thinner it is the better. A core of this sort, rolled up out of sheet iron will give much better results than a core composed of a solid bar of iron.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><span>The end of the core is slipped into an iron "core" cap. This is shown in Figure 101. It consists of a small cylinder, seven-sixteenths of an inch in length, cut from a piece of iron rod, three-eighths of an inch in diameter. A hole nine-thirty-seconds of an inch in diameter and five-sixteenths of an inch deep should be drilled in one end. This cap is slipped over one end of the core. It should fit very tightly so that it will not pull out.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The core is then slipped into the bobbin with the outside end of the core cap projecting about one-sixteenth of an inch out of the end at which the primary terminals lead out. The cap should fit into the bobbin very snugly so that the core is held firmly in place.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>Since the hole through the bobbin is three-eighths of an inch in diameter and the core is only nine-thirty-seconds of an inch in diameter there should be a space all around the core, except at the end where the cap is, so that a thin brass "regulator" tube can be slipped in and out over the tube.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><span>When the tube is slipped over the core and moved in and out of the bobbin, after the coil has been finished and set in operation, it will regulate the strength of the secondary or "shocking" current. When the tube is completely out of the bobbin, the current will be the strongest.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>If a paper scale, divided into sixteenths of an inch and bearing numbers, is pasted around the tube it will act as an indicator of the current strength.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The base is wood and measures four and five-eighths inches long, two and three-quarters inches wide and is one-half an inch thick. The proper location of the various holes can be found by referring to the illustration in Figure 103. The corners of the base should be slightly rounded so as to improve the appearance.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>Figure 104 is a top view of the coil after it has been assembled. The bobbin is mounted a little back of the centre of the base so that the core cap will be opposite the armature of the vibrator.</span></p>

A soft iron armature, five-sixteenths of an inch in diameter and one-eighth of an inch thick is fastened to one end of the spring. A five-thirty-seconds inch hole is drilled in the other end and it is then mounted in the "vibrator posts". This consists of a small brass pillar, one-quarter of an inch in diameter and five-eighths of an inch long. The lower end is drilled, and tapped to receive a 4-36 screw which fastens it to the base. A saw slot one-quarter of an inch deep is made in the top to receive the vibrator spring.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The post which holds the adjustment screw is identical with that which supports the vibrator spring, except that a threaded hole is drilled through the saw slot, fifteen-thirty-seconds of an inch from the bottom, through which the screw passes. The end of the adjustment screw, which may be an ordinary knurled thumbscrew from a binding post, should be fitted with a "contact" point. The best contact point is a piece of platinum, but a small piece of silver can be made to serve the purpose very well.</span></p>

      </div>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The handles for the coil are very easily made out of a piece of brass tubing about two and one-half inches long and five-eighths of an inch in diameter. They can also be made by rolling a piece of sheet brass or tin into a tube and soldering the edges together. The illustration shows two methods of making the handles and attaching the cords. The handle in the upper part of the illustration is made from a piece of tubing. A wooden plug or cork is fitted into one end. The wire passes through a hole in the centre of the plug and is turned back over the edge so that when the plug is forced into the tube, the wire will make contact with it. The handle in the lower part of the illustration is made from one of the brass cylinders in which the indelible ink for rubber stamps is supplied. A hole is bored in the bottom through which the wire passes. The end of the wire is soldered to a piece of stiff brass wire bent into the shape of a hairpin. The ends of the wire are spread apart so that they will spring against the inside of the tube. The connector is then pulled up inside of the handle.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The flexible wires or "cords" as they are sometimes called, attached to the handles, should be about eighteen inches long. The opposite ends to the handles should be led through two holes in the base, in front of the bobbin. The left hand cord should be connected to the vibrator post and the right hand cord to the outside secondary terminal.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The coil is now complete, ready for operation. Connect the battery to the binding posts. Start the interrupter and grasp one of the handles in each hand. Draw the regulator tube out of the bobbin gradually and the current will gradually grow stronger and stronger until it is impossible to hold the handles. When the regulator tube is all the way in the bobbin it is practically impossible to feel the current. Of course any intermediate strength between the two extremes can easily be secured. The shock from the coil is harmless. When the regulator is all the way out, the shock is very strong. The only result, however, is to make the person receiving it drop the handles. The current from medical coils is often prescribed by physicians for rheumatism and nervous disorders, but it must be properly applied in order to be of benefit.</span></p>

      <p class="pfirst"><span>A Spark Coil is one of the most interesting pieces of apparatus that an experimenter can possess. Not only can it be used to transmit wireless messages, but numerous and various experiments may be performed with its aid.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The purpose of a spark coil is to generate enormously high voltages which are able to send sparks across an air space which ordinary battery currents of low voltage could not possibly pierce.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><span>It consists of an iron core surrounded by a coil of heavy wire known as the "primary" and a second outside winding of finer wire known as the "secondary." The primary is connected to a few cells of dry battery in series with an "interrupter."</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>Every time that the interrupter shuts off the battery current in the primary, currents are induced in the secondary which are of sufficiently high voltage or pressure to leap across a space in the shape of sparks.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>A spark coil is not very hard to construct, but it requires careful workmanship and patience. It is not usually a job which can be finished in a day, but will take quite a little time, especially in winding the secondary.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>In describing the construction of a spark coil in this chapter, directions and dimensions have been given for a one-quarter inch coil. The general method of procedure is the same for all sizes of coils, the dimensions only, are different. The experimenter may therefore easily build a larger coil than the one-quarter inch by consulting the tables of dimensions.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>Parts for spark coils are for sale by many electrical houses and it is possible to purchase the complete parts for less than the separate materials would cost.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>Such parts are made by special machinery and therefore are produced quite cheaply.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The Core is made of soft iron "core wire" about No. 20 or 22 B. &amp; S. Gauge. Each piece should be four and three-quarters inches long. Iron wire may be bought already cut to length from various houses dealing in experimenter's supplies. Considering the amount of labor that is required to cut each piece to length arid then straighten it out, it is cheaper to purchase the wire already cut.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><span>Glue the inside and outside edges of the paper so that the tube cannot unroll and then slip the core wires into it until the tube is packed tightly and no more can be slipped in.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The core is now ready for the primary, which consists of two layers of No. 18 B. &amp; S. Gauge cotton covered wire wound over the core for a distance of three and three-quarters inches. The winding should start five-eighths of an inch from one end of the core. The wire must be wound very smoothly and carefully. The inside end of the wire can be fastened so that it will not become loose by placing a short piece of tape lengthwise of the core and winding two or three turns over it. Then double the end back and complete the winding over it. The end of the wire can be fastened by imbedding a piece of tape under the winding with a small loop projecting and then passing the wire through the loop.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>Figure 110 shows the complete core with primary winding in position.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">The Secondary</strong> <span>is a much more tedious job than the primary and must be very carefully made. Whenever it is possible for the experimenter to purchase a secondary already wound he is advised to do so.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The secondary consists of 5,000-6,000 turns of No. 37 B. &amp; S. Gauge, enameled wire wound in smooth, even layers, with two layers of paper between every two layers of wire.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The primary winding is wrapped with six layers of "empire cloth or paper." Empire cloths and papers are a yellow insulating material made by treating linen or paper with linseed oil.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>Roll up a paper tube of five or six layers of paper so that the finished tube is two and one-half inches long and of proper inside diameter to just slip over the primary winding when the empire cloth or paper is in position.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The secondary is wound over this paper tube. It will be necessary to mount the tube on a round wooden mandrel fitted with a small crank or handle so that the tube may be revolved. A "winder" may be very easily made by mounting a round wooden stick of the same diameter as the inside of the paper tube in a pair of wooden supports. Bore a hole in one end of the stick and bend a piece of stiff wire in it so as to form a crank.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><span>Start and end each layer of wire one-half inch from the edges of the paper. Wind the wire in smooth, even layers, permitting each turn to touch the other, but none to lap over. Wind on two layers of waxed paper between each layer of wire and the next. The paper must be put on smoothly and evenly so as to afford a firm foundation for the next layer of wire.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The wire should never come nearer to the edges of the paper than one-half inch or the insulation of the secondary will be weak and the coil not liable to give a long spark.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The utmost care should be used not to break the wire. If it should break, the ends must be very carefully connected. The number of turns that each layer averages should be carefully noted so that by keeping a record of the number of layers it is possible to tell how many turns have been wound on. When five to six thousand turns have been wound on the secondary it is sufficiently large, and the outside end of the wire should be fastened and prevented from unwinding by securing it with a drop of sealing wax.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>When winding a secondary remember that if at any point in the work, you allow the winding to become irregular or uneven, the irregularity will be much exaggerated on the succeeding layers. For this reason do not allow any irregularities to occur and if the wire tends to go unevenly, wind on two or three extra layers of the waxed paper to smooth it out.</span></p>

        <p class="pfirst"><span>The most beautiful and wonderful effects may be obtained from Geissler tubes operated from a spark coil in a dark room. These tubes come in an almost endless variety of styles and shapes. They are exhausted of air and fitted with metallic wires, sealed into the ends, a portion of the wire projecting outside in the form of small rings, so that the connections are easily established.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>Some of the tubes are of ordinary glass, while others are made of glass having in its composition certain metallic oxides. Some of the tubes are filled with various gases in a highly rarified state. Others have a double wall with the outside filled with a fluorescent liquid, such as an aqueous solution of sulphate of quinine or an alcoholic solution of strammonium, and other compounds.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The tubes are not very expensive. They can be obtained in a great variety of sizes. Most well stocked electrical houses carrying goods for the electrical experimenter have them on hand.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>Such tubes are of necessity very fragile articles and should be handled with extreme care. It is a good plan to keep them wrapped in cotton and to put them away in a strong wooden box, so as to reduce the danger of breakage.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The very smallest coil, even the one-quarter inch size, will serve to light a large tube. . In fact, if too large a coil is used, there is danger of spoiling the tube.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The tubes are connected to the spark coil by running a wire from each of the small rings at the ends of the tubes to the secondary terminals. Several tubes may be connected in series when a or 1-inch coil is available.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>To show the best effects, the room should be in perfect darkness and the tubes should be placed against a background of black velvet.</span></p>

        <p class="pfirst"><span>Spread your fingers out and move your hand rapidly back and forth over a lighted Geissler tube in a darkened room. Your hand will appear to have ten or twelve fingers instead of five. This is due to the fact that the light from a Geissler tube is flickering and not at all steady. Each time the interrupter of the coil opens, the current is sent through the tube and lights it momentarily. The flickering is almost too rapid to be perceived by the naked eye until you have something like the fingers or a pencil in front of it.</span></p>

        <p class="pfirst"><span>An extremely pretty effect can be secured by rotating a Geissler tube at high speed while it is lighted. This may be accomplished by means of an electric motor of small size. The tube is tied tightly to a stick of wood which has a hole drilled exactly in its center into which the motor shaft fits tightly. Two rings of metal are mounted on the motor shaft, and a wire is led from each to a terminal of the tube. A copper strip rests on each ring, and these two copper strips are connected to the secondary of the spark coil.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>When the motor is started and the coil set into operation, the tube will appear like the spokes of a wheel. The intermittent light will make the tube visible for a fraction of a second in various positions around the circle as it rotates, and this gives the effect which is much like that of a pinwheel.</span></p>

        <p class="pnext"><span>Place an ordinary photographic plate on a piece of sheet metal with the coated or sensitive side up. Connect the piece of sheet metal to one of the secondary terminals of the spark coil by means of a wire.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>Then sift some dry starch powder, flour of sulphur or talcum powder through a thin piece of gauze on to the plate.

        <p class="pnext"><span>Wipe the powder off the plate thoroughly and develop it in the usual manner. The negative will show a peculiar electric discharge looking very much like sea moss.

      <p class="pfirst"><span>It is very difficult to construct a first class dynamo without resort to the materials and methods employed in the manufacture of commercial machines. The necessity for careful workmanship in every detail, can hardly be overestimated. Poor workmanship and poor materials will always result in an inefficient machine. Telegraph instruments, toy motors, etc., may be constructed from all sorts of odds and ends of materials, and they will work fairly well, but in order to make a real dynamo it will be necessary to use certain materials for which nothing can be substituted.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><span>Both the field and the armature of the small dynamo described in the following pages are cast iron and patterns will be necessary in order to form the moulds for the castings. It may be possible for several experimenters to club together and make the patterns, or have them made, for building this dynamo.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The dynamo described has an output of about ten watts. It may also be used as a motor and as such will develop considerable power. The castings for this machine are already on the market and may be obtained from the publishers of this book.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><span>The easiest way to bore out the "tunnel" of the field is to perform the work on a lathe. If no lathe is handy, the work can be accomplished with nothing more than the aid of a file and a little patience. It should be cleaned out until it is perfectly round and measures one and five-sixteenths of an inch in diameter.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>Any rough spots on the casting should be smoothed up with a file.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">The Armature</strong> <span>is illustrated in Figure 125. The centre of the armature should be bored out to fit a three-sixteenths inch shaft.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The shaft is a piece of steel rod four inches long. The outside of the armature should be turned down to a diameter of one and one-quarter inches, making it one-sixteenth of an inch smaller in diameter than the tunnel in the field.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">The Commutator</strong> <span>is illustrated in Figure 126. It has two sections and consists of a short piece of brass tubing fitted on a fibre core and split lengthwise on two opposite sides so that each section is insulated from the other.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>It is not very difficult to make such a commutator. A hole is drilled through the fibre, which fits very tightly on the shaft. The shaft is then placed in a lathe with the fibre in position and the latter turned down until a piece of seven-sixteenths inch brass tubing can be driven on. The tube should be five-eighths of an inch long. Then mark two lines along the tube at points diametrically opposite. Bore two small holes to receive two small screws, a short distance away from each side of these lines and on each side of them. Make certain that the screws do not go into the fibre far enough to touch the shaft. The commutator may then be split along each side of the lines with a hacksaw, continuing the cut right through the brass and slightly into the insulating core. The heads of the screws should be filed off flush with the surface of the commutator and the latter trued up and made perfectly smooth.</span></p>

Then use it as a template to lay out the other laminations by placing it on the metal and scribing a line around the edges with a sharp pointed needle. Enough laminations should be cut out to make a pile five-eighths of an inch high when tightly pressed together.</span></p>

It consists of a piece of brass tubing seven-sixteenths of an inch long, five-sixteenths inside and three-eighths of an inch outside. It should be forced onto a piece of fibre five-sixteenths of an inch in diameter and seven-sixteenths of an inch long. Split the tube into three equal parts by dividing it longitudinally with a hack-saw. Make a fibre ring which will force onto the tube very tightly when it is in position on the fibre core and so hold the three commutator sections firmly in position. The sections should be so arranged that there is a small space between each two and they are perfectly insulated from each other. The fibre core should have a one-eighth inch hole through the centre so that it may be forced tightly onto the shaft and up against the armature after the windings are in position. The commutator should be in such a position that the split between each two sections come directly opposite the centre of each winding. Suppose that the windings are lettered A, B, and C, the commutator section between A and B is numbered 1, that between A and C is No. 2, and the one between C and B is No. 3. Then the inside terminal of B is connected to the outside terminal of A and soldered to the end of commutator section No. 1 close to the winding. The inside end of B is connected to the outside terminal of C and to commutator section No. 2. The inside end of winding C is connected to the outside of B and to commutator section No. 3. The connection of the armature windings to the commutator are represented by the diagram in Figure 139.</span></p>

      <p class="pfirst"><span>An Electric engine is really a form of electric motor but differs from the most common form of the latter in that the armature, instead of revolving, oscillates back and forth, like the piston of a steam or gasoline engine. Electric engines are not as efficient as electric motors from the standpoint of the amount of power delivered in proportion to the current used, but they make very interesting models and the young experimenter will derive fully as much pleasure in constructing one as from the construction of an electric motor. Various forms of electric engines were made before the first practical electric motor was invented. They amounted to little more than curiosities, however, and could only be used where the expense of electric current was not to be regarded.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><span>The engine illustrated in Figure 143 is of the double action type. It is provided with two electromagnets arranged so that one pulls the armature forward and the other pulls it back. The motion of the armature is transmitted to the shaft by means of a connecting rod and crank. It is very simple to build and the design is such that it will operate equally well whether it is made large or small. If you do not happen to have all the necessary materials to build an engine according to the dimensions shown in the drawings you can make it just one-half that size and it will work equally well although it will of course not give as much power.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The complete engine is shown in Figure 143. All the various parts have been marked so that you can easily identify them in the other drawings. It is well to study this illustration carefully first so that you will understand just how all the parts are arranged.</span></p>

The magnets shown in Figure 145 are made of three-eighths inch round iron, two and one-half inches long, provided with two fibre washers one and one-eighth inches in diameter. One end of each of the steel cores is drilled and tapped to receive an 8-32 iron screw. The experimenter may possibly be able to secure some old magnet cores fitted with fibre heads from an old telephone bell or "ringer" as they are sometimes called. A suitable bolt can be made to serve the purpose by cutting it off to the right dimensions with a hack saw. If a drill and a tap are not available for drilling and tapping the end so that the core can be properly mounted in the frame of the engine it is possible by the exercise of a little ingenuity to use the threaded portion of a bolt to good advantage. The hole in the frame should then be made larger so that the end of the bolt will slip through instead of an 8-32 screw and the core clamped in position by a nut on each side.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The fibre washers are spaced two and one-sixteenth inches apart. The space in between should be wound full of No. 18 B. &amp; S. Gauge cotton covered magnet wire. Before winding in the wire, cover the core with a layer of paper so that the wire does not touch the metal. The ends of the wire should be led out through small holes in the fibre heads.</span></p>

It is made of a strip of wrought iron or cold rolled steel, nine and one-quarter inches long, an inch or an inch and one-eighth wide and one-eighth of an inch thick. The material for making this part of the engine and also the bearings can probably best be obtained at some blacksmith shop or hardware store. Heavy galvanized iron can be used but it is not usually thick enough and it may be necessary use two thicknesses. The ends of the strip are rounded and bent at right angles so as to form a U-shaped piece with sides one and three-quarters inches high. The holes D and E should be large enough to pass an 8-32 screw. The holes A, B and C should be about one-eighth of an inch in diameter. They are used to pass the screw which hold the frame of the engine to the wooden base.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">The Bearings</strong> <span>are shown in Figure 147. They are U-shaped and are made out of a strip of iron or steel in the same manner as the frame of the engine but are three-quarters of an inch wide instead of an inch and one-eighth. The dimensions will be understood best by referring to the drawing. The 3/32 inch holes near the top of each side are the bearing holes for each end of the shaft. The one-eighth inch holes below are used to fasten the brush holder in position. The holes in the bottom serve to fasten the bearings to the base.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">The Shaft</strong> <span>will probably prove the most difficult part of the engine to make properly. The details are given in Figure 148. It is made of a piece of one-eighth inch steel rod bent so that it has a "throw" of one-half an inch, that is, is offset one-quarter of an inch so that the connecting rod moves back and forth a distance of one half an inch. The finished shaft should be three inches long. The piece of steel used should be longer than this, so that it can be cut off to exact dimensions after the shaft is finished. A second crank should be bent in one end of the shaft so as to form an offset contact for the brushes. This second crank will have to be at right angles to the first one and should be much smaller. The ends of the shaft are turned or filed down to a diameter of three-thirty second of an inch for a distance of about the same amount so that they will fit in the bearing holes and turn freely but not allow the whole shaft to slip through. The work of making the shaft will require a small vice, a light hammer, files and a couple of pairs of pliers. One pair of pliers should be of the round nosed type and the other a pair of ordinary square jawed side cutters. It may require two or three attempts before a perfect shaft is secured. When finished it should be perfectly true and turn freely in the holes. The bearings can be adjusted slightly by bending so that the shaft will fit in the holes and be free but yet not be loose enough to slip out.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">The Armature</strong> <span>is a strip of soft iron, two and one-eighth inches long, seven-sixteenths of an inch wide and three-sixteenths of an inch thick. A one-sixteenth inch slot, three-eighths of an inch long is cut in one end. A one-sixteenth inch hole is drilled through from one side to the other, one-eighth of an inch from each end. The hole which passes through the slot is used to pass the pin which pivots the armature to the connecting rod. The other hole is used to mount the armature in its bearing. The armature bearing is a small edition of the one which is used to support the engine shaft. The details and the dimensions are given in the lower left hand side of Figure 149. The armature is shown in the centre of the same illustration. The connecting rod is illustrated at the right. This is made from a strip of three-sixty-fourths inch brass, three-sixteenths of an inch wide and one and five-eighths inches long. A one-eighth inch hole should be drilled close to one end and a one-sixteenth inch hole close to the other.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">The Flywheel</strong><span>. It may be possible to secure a flywheel for the engine from some old toy. It should be about three and one-half inches in diameter. A flywheel can be made out of sheet iron or steel by following the suggestion in Figure 151, which shows a wheel cut out of one-eighth inch sheet steel. It is given the appearance of having spokes by boring six three-quarter inch holes through the face as shown. The hole in the centre of the wheel should be one-eighth of an inch in diameter. The wheel is slipped over the shaft and fastened in position by soldering.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The parts are now all ready to assemble into the complete engine. Mount the electromagnets in the frame and fasten the frame down to the wooden base so that one end of the frame comes practically flush with the left hand edge of the base. Fasten the bearing across the frame at right angles by a screw passing through the centre hole in the bottom of the bearing, through the hole A and into the base. The bottom of the bearing should be bent slightly so as to straddle the frame. The bearings should be secured and prevented from turning or twisting by two screws passed through the other two holes in the bottom. Use round-headed wood screws in mounting the bearing and the frame. The armature bearing should be mounted on the frame directly between the two electromagnets. Then place the armature in position by slipping a piece of one-sixteenth inch brass rod through the bearing holes and the hole in the lower part of the armature.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><span>Solder the flywheel in position on the shaft and snap the latter into the bearings. Adjust the bearings so that the shaft will turn freely. The connecting rod should be slipped over the shaft before it is placed in the bearings. Fasten the other end of the connecting rod to the armature by means of a piece of one-sixteenth inch brass rod which passes through the small holes bored for that purpose. When the flywheel is spun with the fingers, the armature should move back and forth between the two electromagnets and almost but not quite touch the two magnet poles. All the moving parts should be fitted firmly together but be free enough so that there is no unnecessary friction and so that the engine will continue to run for a few seconds when the flywheel is spun with the fingers.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The brushes, supported on their fibre block should be mounted on the bearing by means of two screws passing through the holes in the bearing into the block. The position of the brushes should be such that the shaft passes between the two upper ends but does not touch them unless the small contact crank mentioned above is in proper position to do so. The proper adjustment of the brushes, so that they make contact with the shaft at the proper moment, will largely determine the speed and power which the finished engine will develop.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>Two binding posts should be mounted on the right hand end of the base so that the engine can be easily connected to a battery. Connect one terminal of the right hand electromagnet to one of the binding posts. Run the other terminal of the electromagnet to the brush on the opposite side of the shaft. Connect one terminal of the left hand electromagnet to the other binding post and run the other terminal to the brush on the opposite side of the shaft. Save for a few minor adjustments, the engine is now ready to run. Connect two or three cells of dry battery to the two binding posts and turn the flywheel so that it moves from right to left across the top. Just as the crank passes "dead centre" and the armature starts to move back away from the left hand magnet, the small contact crank should touch the left hand brush and send the current through the right hand magnet. This will draw the armature over to the right. Just before the armature gets all the way over to the right, the contact should break connection with the left hand brush and interrupt the current so that the inertia of the flywheel will cause it to keep moving and the armature to start to move over towards the left hand magnet at which point the contact on the shaft should commence to bear against the right hand brush, thus throwing the left hand magnet into circuit and drawing the armature over to that side. If the brushes and the cranks are in proper relation to each other the engine will continue to repeat this operation and gradually gain speed until it is running at a good rate.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The appearance of the engine can be improved by painting the metal parts black and the flywheel red. The magnets can be wrapped with a piece of bright red cloth to protect the wire against injury and brighten the appearance of the engine.</span></p>

      <h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><span>CHAPTER XV. MINIATURE BATTERY LIGHTING.</span></h2>
      <p class="pfirst"><span>The tungsten lamp has opened wonderful possibilities in the field of electric lighting by means of miniature lamps operated from batteries.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The tungsten lamp uses less than one third the amount of current required by the old-fashioned carbon filament lamps in producing the same candle power. This means that the battery will last three times as long.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>Miniature lighting is one of the most practical phases of experimental electricity to which the experimenter can apply his time. Battery operated lamps will be found invaluable in many places for lighting dark corners, hallways, barns, garages, camps, bungalows, workshops, etc.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">Tungsten Battery Lamps</strong> <span>are made in a great many different styles and sizes.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The smallest sizes are used for flashlights, hand-lanterns, etc. These are not rated according to their candlepower, but to the voltage which they should be operated on. Flashlight lamps will be found satisfactory as a means of illuminating closets, cellars, stairways, etc., but do not give sufficient light for reading or any purpose of that sort. The light which they give varies from one to three candle-power according to the size of the lamp. They are made for 1.5, 2.8, 3.8 and 5.8 volts or respectively one, two, three and four dry cells. Flashlight lamps are provided with what is known as a miniature base only.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>A very simple lighting arrangement which will prove exceedingly useful for illuminating a dark closet, a coal bin or the face of a clock, etc., consists of a 1.5 volt lamp, a single cell of dry battery and a suitable switch and wire. Such an installation may be made at a cost of less than seventy-five cents.</span></p>
      <div class="align-center auto-scaled figure margin" style="width: 100%" id="figure-2164">

      </div>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The lamp is mounted in what is known as a miniature porcelain base receptacle. The switch may most conveniently be the type termed a "wood base" switch. In case the lamp is installed for illuminating a clock, a "pear push" and a flexible cord may be substituted for turning the light off and on in place of the switch. It can then be suitably hung alongside of the clock or bed as desired.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The wire should not be smaller than No. 18 B. &amp; S. Gauge or else it will offer too much resistance to the electric current and full benefit of the candle-power of the lamp will not be secured. Annunciator wire is preferable. It has good insulation and at the same time is not too large to be easily run through corners, cracks, etc.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The diagram in Figure 153 shows how to connect the lamp to the battery and switch. Figure 156 shows two dry cells connected in series for use with a 2.8 volt lamp.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><span>When more illumination is desired than that furnished by flashlight lamps greater candle-power will be required. The following table shows the voltages and candle-powers of those lamps which are most suitable in such an instance:</span></p>
      <ul class="simple">

          <p class="first pfirst"><span>G8 6 volts 6 candle-power</span></p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="pfirst"><span>They may also be operated from dry cells. If they are intended to be in use for other than a few minutes at a time it will be well to use a battery consisting of two sets of cells connected in series multiple. The method of connecting cells in series multiple has already been illustrated in Figure 35. This will lighten the strain on the battery and it will be found that two sets of batteries used in series multiple will last</span> <strong class="bold">more than twice</strong> <span>as long as one set used alone.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><span>The tungsten lamps made for automobiles are ideal for miniature lighting plants operated by storage batteries. The list below shows some of the sizes on a current of six to eight volts.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The bases are made of brass and come in four different styles, miniature, candelabra, single Ediswan and double Ediswan.

      <p class="pnext"><span>You can compute the approximate amount of current drawn from a battery by a tungsten lamp, by dividing the candle-power by the voltage.

An ampere hour is the amount of current represented by one ampere flowing for one hour. A forty ampere hour cell will deliver one ampere for forty hours, 4 amperes for ten hours or 5 amperes for eight hours. The ampere hour capacity of a storage cell divided by the amount of current being used will determine how long that current can be drawn before recharging is necessary.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The maximum amount of current it is safe to draw from a storage cell without impairing its life and efficiency is the maximum current which that cell can deliver continuously for eight hours. In order to determine this current simply divide the manufacturer's rating of the battery in ampere hours by eight. The answer is the maximum current you should require from the battery if you wish to obtain good service from it. For example, the maximum safe discharge rate of a 40 ampere hour battery is 40 divided by 8 or 5 amperes.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><span>The method of computing the current required by a lamp and the method for determining the maximum safe discharge rate of a battery will enable you to figure the size of the smallest battery it is desirable to use in a lighting plant.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>Suppose that you intend to use three 6 volt 12 candlepower lamps. Each lamp will require two amperes or a total of six when all three lamps are burning at the same time. Six amperes multiplied by eight ampere hours equals 48 ampere hours. This is the smallest size of battery which should be used. If it is larger, it will be advantageous, because it will supply the lamps a correspondingly longer time without recharging.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>Figure 155 shows some of the sockets or receptacles which are on the market. The illustration to the left is a "flat base receptacle." It will be found most useful when the lamp is to be mounted directly on the wall or ceiling. The weatherproof type of socket may be secured with either a fibre or a porcelain shell.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">The Wire</strong> <span>used to connect the system will depend upon where the lamps are located. Annunciator or office wire as it is sometimes called will serve in most cases where the wires are to be run entirely indoors. The largest size made is No. 16 B. &amp; S. Gauge. This is the size which should be used. Annunciator wire is made in various colors so that it can be more easily concealed.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>If the wires are run outdoors, or somewhat exposed to the weather, as on a porch or in a barn, it is advisable to use weatherproof or rubber covered wire.

      <p class="pnext"><span>If the lamps are larger than eight candle-power, or several are to be used on the same line, the wires should be larger than No. 16. When a battery is connected to a system of wires, the voltage at the end of the line is much lower than it is at the battery terminals. This is due to the resistance of the wire and is called "voltage drop." The lamps at the end of the line will not burn as brilliantly as those close to the battery. This can be partially overcome by using large wire.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The lamps may be either connected in series or in multiple. When a six volt battery is used, it will be necessary to connect them in multiple. Figure 159 shows how several lamps may be connected in multiple and controlled by one switch. Figure 160 shows the same lamps with three separate switches so that each lamp may be turned on or off individually.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><span>In order to secure these results it will be necessary to substitute a device called a "coherer" for the detector in the receiving apparatus.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>A coherer consists essentially of a few metal filings between two metal plugs. The filings are made part of a circuit which includes a relay and a battery. Under ordinary conditions the filings lie loosely together and their resistance to an electric current is so great that they will not allow enough energy to flow to operate the relay. If, however, the two plugs are connected to the aerial and ground so that the currents of the incoming wireless signals also pass through the filings, they will suddenly "cohere" or stick together and permit sufficient current to pass to operate the relay.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><span>A "tapper," or as it is also sometimes called a "decoherer," is also arranged in the circuit so as to automatically shake the filings up and restore them to their loose state as soon as each signal is received. The decoherer consists simply of an ordinary bell mounted so that the hammer will strike the coherer and jar it.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The first thing required in order to make a coherer is a pair of double binding posts. These should be mounted on a wooden base six inches long and four inches wide as shown in Figure 163.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>A piece of glass tubing about one and one-half inches long and one-eighth of an inch in diameter inside together with some brass rod which will just slip into the tube tightly will be required.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><span>Slip these rods through the upper holes in the binding posts and into the glass tube as shown in Figure 163. Be sure that everything lines up perfectly and then remove one of the plugs.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>Before putting the plug back in place put some nickel and silver filings in the tube so that when the rods are pushed almost together, with only a distance of three-sixty-fourths to one-sixteenth of an inch between, the filings will about half fill the space.</span></p>

The filings may be secured by holding a five cent piece over a clean sheet of paper and filing it with a coarse file. The silver filings are made in the same way by using a ten cent piece or a quarter in place of the nickel.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>Do not use the fine dust and powder which is formed, but only the coarse filings.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The success of the coherer will depend upon its adjustment and it will probably be necessary for the beginner to experiment considerably to find out just the right amount of filings to place in the tube and how far apart the brass plugs should be placed.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The decoherer is made by removing the gong from an old electric bell and mounting the bell on the base in the position shown in Figure 163. The hammer should be bent so that it will tap the coherer lightly when a battery is connected to the bell binding posts.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The only thing required to complete the apparatus is a relay.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>A relay of the "Pony" type such as that shown in Figure 164 will serve for ordinary work. It should be wound to at least 150 ohms, for to a certain extent, the higher the resistance, the more sensitive it will be.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>When it is desired to secure the maximum possible distance with the coherer a "polarized" relay will be necessary. A polarized relay is much more sensitive than the ordinary sort. The polarized relay should be wound to 1000 ohms.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><span>When wireless signals pass through the relay they will cause the resistance to drop and allow sufficient current from the dry cell to pass through the coherer to energize the magnets of the relay and draw the armature in, thus closing the decoherer circuit. When the armature of the relay is drawn in towards the magnets the relay contacts are brought together. This closes the decoherer circuit and starts the hammer to tapping the coherer, thus restoring the filings to their former loose state. The decoherer will tap the coherer as long as the incoming signals continue. By breaking the signals up into dots and dashes of the telegraph code a message may be easily transmitted and read from the tapping of the decoherer.</span></p>

The condenser should consist of two or three Leyden jars or several glass plates coated with tinfoil. It is impossible to determine just how much capacity the condenser should have in advance, because the length of the conducting wires, adjustment of the spark gap, etc., will have considerable effect. The condenser is connected directly across the terminals of the spark coil. The spark gap may consist of two one-eighth inch brass rods supported by two double binding posts mounted on a small wooden block.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The induction coil should be as large as possible. When the coil is set in operation it will charge the condenser and a white, snappy spark should pass across the gap. If the fingers are brought near to one of the secondary terminals of the Tesla coil, a small, reddish purple spark will jump out to meet them. It will be necessary to adjust the apparatus very carefully before a spark of any considerable length can be obtained. Changing the length of the spark gap and the size of the condenser will undoubtedly produce results. It may also be possible to lengthen the high frequency spark by disconnecting one of the wires from the primary binding posts on the Tesla coil and connecting the wire directly to some one of the primary turns. A very small change in some one of the connections may produce considerable result. The purpose of the adjustments is to tune the circuit in the same manner that a wireless outfit is tuned by altering the capacity of the condenser or varying the number of turns in the helix.</span></p>

The arrangement described in the following chapter may be built by almost any boy and will prove a very interesting and instructive piece of apparatus.

However if you have a chum who lives next door or across the street or within the distance named above, it is easily possible for you to construct a wireless telephone which will enable you to remain in your own rooms and hold a conversation with each other, without any connecting wires.</span></p>

Michael Faraday, who was a famous English scientist, discovered in 1831 that if a magnet is suddenly plunged into a hollow coil of wire, a momentary current of electricity is generated in the coil. You can try this experiment for yourself by connecting a galvanometer with a hollow coil of wire and then suddenly plunging a bar magnet into the coil.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>If you observe closely you will notice that the needle of the galvanometer is deflected, this indicating that a current has passed through the circuit.

The mechanical work done in moving the magnet is really the source of electrical energy. The medium which changes the mechanical energy into electricity is called the magnetic field. The real nature of a magnetic field is very hard to explain and not easily understood. It is a peculiar state or condition of the space in the immediate neighborhood of a magnet. It is possible to show its existence by placing a sheet of cardboard over a magnet and then sprinkling iron filings over the surface of the cardboard. If the cardboard is tapped slightly, the filings will settle down in curving lines, forming a magnetic "phantom." The curved lines into which the filings form themselves, represent the paths of the lines of force which make up the magnetic field. The illustration in Figure 180 shows the magnetic phantom about a bar magnet.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>When the space in the neighborhood of a wire or a coil of wire through which a current of electricity is passing is examined by means of some iron filings sprinkled on a sheet of cardboard, it is found that a similar state of affairs exists there and that it also possesses a magnetic field.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>This can be readily shown by punching a small hole in the centre of a sheet of cardboard or stiff paper and passing a wire which is carrying a strong current of electricity through the hole at right angles to the surface of the cardboard. Sprinkle some iron filings on the cardboard and they will arrange themselves in circles around the wire, forming a magnetic phantom giving definite proof to the eyes of the existence of the magnetic field.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>Some of my readers may have begun to wonder what a magnetic field has to do with the operation of the wireless telephone. It has already been explained that this particular type of wireless telephone depends upon magnetic induction for its operation. It is necessary to have some sort of a conception of the magnetic field before you will be able to understand magnetic induction.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><span>In order that you may gain an idea of how the instruments work, suppose that two coils of wire, A and B, are connected as shown in Figure 182. The coil A is connected in series with a set of batteries and a telegraph key. The other coil B is connected to a telephone receiver. The coils are placed parallel to each other and only a few inches apart. When the key is pressed so that the circuit is complete and the battery current flows through the coil A, it creates a magnetic field in the vicinity of the coil and lines of force are set up in the immediate neighborhood.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The lines of force will travel through and about coil B and</span> <strong class="bold">induce in it a current of electricity</strong><span>. The electric current will cause a sound like a click in the telephone receiver. When a telephone transmitter is substituted for the key and words are spoken into the mouthpiece, the current passing through the coil from the battery will be varied in accordance with the vibrations of the voice. The changes in the current will produce changes in the magnetic field set up by the coil and the changes in the magnetic field will produce a varying current in the coil B so that the words will be distinctly repeated by the receiver connected to B.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><span>This experiment is very easy to perform and may be carried out by almost any boy with the materials he probably already has around his shop. Twenty-five to thirty turns of magnet wire of almost any size wound around one end of a cardboard tube three or four inches in diameter will serve as the coil A. A similar coil wound around the tube five or six inches away, an ordinary telephone transmitter and receiver and two or three dry cells form all the rest of the equipment desired. Words spoken into the transmitter connected to the coil A will be distinctly heard in the telephone receiver connected to the coil B, although there is no connection between the two coils other than the</span> <strong class="bold">magnetic field</strong><span>. Such an outfit as this is of course only experimental and intended solely for the purpose of demonstrating the principles of operation of the larger outfit. If it is desired to make a practical set for talking over a considerable distance it will be necessary to make coils much larger in diameter and to build them so they contain a larger number of turns.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><span>Large coils can be made by drawing a circle about four feet in diameter on the floor of your shop. Then drive a number of small nails around the circle about three inches apart. This arrangement will serve as a form to wind the coil. After the winding is completed you can pull a few of the nails out and lift it off and you will have a circular coil four feet in diameter. Two coils will be required. They should be made of No. 20 B. &amp; S. Gauge cotton covered wire. Each coil should contain about seventy-five turns of wire. About three pounds of wire will be required for each coil. After winding the coils should be tied with string or tape about every six inches so that they will not come apart. The nails can then be pulled out of the floor and the coil is ready for use. If it is intended to subject the coils to any amount of handling, it is a good idea to secure two large hoops such as girls use for rolling along the sidewalk, about four feet in diameter. Then make the coils exactly the same diameter as the hoops and when they are finished bind them to the hoops with tape. Two binding posts may be mounted on each of the hoops and the terminals of the coil connected to them.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>Two coils are required in order to establish a complete wireless telephone system, one at each station. Each coil may be used for both sending and receiving messages. Each station should be arranged as in Figure 184. The transmitter should be of the type known as "long distance." The switch is a two point switch.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><span>It is a good plan to use two telephone receivers mounted on a head band so that both ears can be used and the hands left free to manipulate the switch. If a set of telephone receivers wound to a high resistance for wireless telegraph purposes is used it will greatly increase the range of the outfit.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>Six to eight first class dry cells will be required to form the battery. A push button is placed in series with the transmitter so that the battery current will be consumed only when the button is pressed. This makes it necessary to push the button when sending a message. When the lever of the two point switch rests on the contact A the circuit is completed for transmitting. When the lever rests on B the telephone receivers are connected to the coil and the apparatus is ready for receiving a message.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>If the apparatus is used only for demonstrating purposes, a camera tripod will be found very convenient for supporting the coils. The transmitter and switch can be fastened to the top of the tripod and the batteries placed in a box on the ground. It is absolutely necessary that the coils be perfectly parallel to each other when messages are being transmitted back and forth. It is well to start with the coils comparatively close to each other, say ten or twelve feet at first, and then gradually increase the distance.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>Coils approximately four feet in diameter and containing about seventy-five turns of wire will transmit and receive messages about one hundred and fifty feet. The range can be increased slightly by using more batteries. If too much battery is used, however, the telephone transmitter will become very hot and is liable to burn out.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>It is impossible, of course, to "call up" over a set of wireless phones such as these. If you succeed in getting your set to work satisfactorily with your chum across the street and wish to talk to him it will be necessary for you to arrange some predetermined time.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>In order to operate your phone place the switch lever on the contact A. Hold your finger tightly against the push button so that the circuit is completed and talk slowly and distinctly into the transmitter. The transmitter will operate the best when the mouthpiece points on a level with your mouth. The lips should be about one inch away from the mouthpiece. Speak in a low even tone. The switch at your friend's station should be resting on B. When you finish speaking throw your switch to B and listen in your telephone receivers. The operator at the other station should throw his switch to A and push the button. He may then talk to you.</span></p>

The process may be outlined as follows: Thoroughly clean the article to be electroplated so as to remove all grease and dirt. Attach it to the negative pole of the battery and suspend it in an electrolyte composed of some chemical salt of the metal to be deposited. In order to maintain the strength of the solution, a piece of metal of the kind to be deposited is attached to the positive electrode.</span></p>

The rods are made of brass or copper and are threaded at one end so as to be provided with binding posts. The centre rod is the one from which the articles to be plated are suspended. They should be attached to it by means of a thin copper wire. The two outside rods support the anodes. The anodes are sheets of metal of the kind to be deposited which, in the case of copper plating, would be copper, in a case of silver plating silver, nickel for nickel plating, etc.</span></p>

        <p class="pfirst"><span>If a sewing needle is connected to one of the discharge rods of a static machine and the point of the needle is presented to the flame of the candle while the machine is in operation, the flame will be repelled just as if a breeze or current of air were issuing from the needle. This is caused by the "brush" discharge which takes place whenever high voltage electricity has a chance to escape from a sharp point or edge. The brush discharge will be much more marked if the condensers or Leyden Jars are not connected to the discharge rods. The "electric breeze" can be felt if the point of the needle is brought near to the side of the face. It is necessary that the needle and the wire connecting it to the static machine be very carefully insulated from all surrounding objects which might dissipate the electricity before it has an opportunity to escape from the needle point.</span></p>

        <p class="pnext"><span>It consists of four celluloid "ping-pong" balls, B, B, B, B, covered with tinfoil and mounted on opposite ends of two wooden spokes. The balls should be at right angles to each other as shown in the illustration. The spokes pass through a cork. The cork is mounted on a wire spoke or knitting needle passing through its centre and supported in small notches in the top of two upright wooden bearings. The device must be very carefully balanced so that the slightest impulse will cause it to spin and so that there will not be any dead centre.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The upright bearings are mounted on a wooden base. Two other tinfoil covered balls A, A, are supported on glass or rubber insulating rods at opposite ends of the base on a level with the axle and in such a position that the balls B, B, B, B, almost touch A and A as they swing past.</span></p>

        <p class="pfirst"><span>This is the age of electricity. The most fascinating of all books for a boy must therefore be one dealing with the mystery of this ancient force and modern wonder, even a mere list of whose services is impossible. The best qualified of experts to instruct boys, Alfred P. Morgan, has in a book far superior to any other of its kind told not only how to make all kinds of motors, telegraphs, telephones, batteries, etc., and to do so economically, but has explained the principles upon which these depend for operation, and how the same thing is done in the every-day world be well presented and so attractive is this really great book that it will be an education for any bright boy to have it, as well as the best kind of a moral safeguard, by leaving no time or thought for evil, and a means of future benefit beyond the power of any one to reckon. Glancing over the pages of this book, one cannot but be impressed by the excellent illustrations, clearness of expression and the large number of subjects that are covered. It is beyond doubt the best book in this line that has ever been written or published. It is a book that will delight every boy who has a leaning towards electrical experiments. The author writes in a clear and chatty style and while he has a thorough technical knowledge of his subject he has succeeded in treating it in a simple manner so that it is readily intelligible to his young readers.</span></p>

        <h3 class="level-3 pfirst section-title title"><span>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</span></h3>
        <p class="pfirst"><span>Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit</span> <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate">https://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate</a></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit:</span> <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate">https://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate</a></p>

        <h3 class="level-3 pfirst section-title title"><span>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works.</span></h3>
        <p class="pfirst"><span>Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>Corrected</span> <em class="italics">editions</em> <span>of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed.</span> <em class="italics">Versions</em> <span>based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:</span></p>
